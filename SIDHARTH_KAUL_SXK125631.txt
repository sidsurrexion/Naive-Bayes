Read Me File:

1. The Naive Bayes classfication is carried out in the driver program called NaiveBayesDriver.java.

2. Similarly to execute the Logistic Regression program, the driver program LogisticDriver.java is
called.

3. On running the naive bayes file, user is asked to enter the laplace constant. Since the laplace
constant is considered here as integer, an integer is supposed to be provided.

4. Similarly, in case of Logistic file execution, user is asked to enter the three values. First value
is the number of iteration required for Gradient Descent, second is the regularization factor(lambda) and
the third is learning rate. First value is an integer, second value is an integer and the third value is a
double. User can put spacebar between each written value and can push enter once all the values 
have been put. In case user does not provide a value and enters then the default values for
all these inputs shall be taken.

5. The training and test folders have been kept in the program directory itself. In case new files
are to be added in the training folders then they can be added in the ham and spam folders.
Program has a set up in which it reads the directory and traverses through each file. 
[Note: Eclipse and 'Java through CMD' recognize different folders as home folder. Hence because of
this reason I have placed the training and test files inside the src directory as well.] 

6. Program computes the accuracy without stop words removal and after stop words removal on
one execution. The result has been posted in the report file.

7. Commands of execution:
C:\Users\Snow_Leopard\workspace\TextClassification\src>javac NaiveBayesDriver.java
C:\Users\Snow_Leopard\workspace\TextClassification\src>java NaiveBayesDriver

Enter the digit for Laplace Smoothing: 

1

(Input for the Naive Bayes Classification)

C:\Users\Snow_Leopard\workspace\TextClassification\src>javac LogisticDriver.java 
C:\Users\Snow_Leopard\workspace\TextClassification\src>java LogisticDriver

Enter the number of iterations, regularization factor and the learning rate
20 10 0.01

(Input for the Logistic Regression)
